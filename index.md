### CPSC 120

##Lab 5

In Lab 5, I used “if statement” for the first time in lab class. So, I could control the flow of code which made code more vivid. Also, in part 2, I used max and min function of `std::numeric_limits<int>` class for defining the range of valid number. This was new approaches to prevent code from bugs for me.

##Lab 7

In Lab 7, the part 1 was easier for me because I already finished it in another lab class. However, the part 2 was most demanding part for me. It seems it consists of simple structure with “if statement”. But it was hard part using “if statement” properly for optimizing the code. Various parking sign has its own time range. Considering all of it at once and making code was complicated for me.

##Lab 8

In Lab 8, like lab 7, part 1 was easy because it was previous one. And part-2 was not a hard part. But there were some new functions or expressions for me. The part 2 was simple average computing question. When user input the numbers, computer calculates the average of the numbers. I could know `vector.empty` function and a different way to express `argument{argv, argv + argc}`. It was good experience to know various different approaches.
